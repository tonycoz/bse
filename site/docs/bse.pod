=head1 CHANGES

=head2 0.10

WARNING: the tag for articles found for a search has changed from:

  article I<field>

to:

  result I<field>

There is a new module required: HTML::Parser

=over 4

=item *

the <:embed child:> tags meaning has been expanded to allow embedding
of any article with an optional template

=item *

there's now an embed[] tag for use in body text.  Both this and 
<:embed ... :> are protected against infinite recursion.

=item *

changed display values for sections etc in Constants.pm, you can still
put your own in when you customize.

=item *

the default templates for each level have been set to a single
template, for a simpler default setup

=item *

new admin index pages, which may display a little better in some
browsers

=item *

you can move articles between levels, if enabled in Constants.pm

=item *

unquoted search terms will do "start of word" searches if enabled in 
Constants.pm

=item *

html[] tags and <html> body text now has tags stripped when displayed
as a summary or as a search excerpt.  The search indexing can now
handle both of these too.

=item *

the search template now uses 'result' rather than 'article' for the
search result entries.  This is needed since the search base page is
generated as an article, using a dummy article.  The title and
titleImage for this dummy article can be specified in Constants.pm.

=item *

you can now control whether an unlisted level1 article is displayed in
the crumbs for an article.

=item *

a bunch of new templates from adrian, including moving the common
layout into base.tmpl where possible, support for "sidebars".

=item *

a formatting guide article in initial.pl (from adrian) (and then an
updated version of it)

=item *

renamed INSTALL to INSTALL.txt to prevent wierdness if someone tries
"make install" on a case-insensitive file system.

=item *

administration templates are now kept in the admin directory in the
templates directory

=item *

added simple test installer.  WARNING: this destroys the existing content
of your site.

=item *

distribution now includes site/htdocs/shop as a directory rather than
as a file

=item *

schema/bse.sql now drops the tables if they already exist

=item *

the item description in the shopping cart is now a link to the item

=item *

changed some defaults in Constants.pm

=item *

catalog templates from $TMPLDIR/templates/catalogs weren't being handled
correctly

=back

=head2 0.09

=over 4

=item *

added support for controlling access to the regenerate option

=item *

added the ability to disable auto-regeneration

this initially broke some buttons, fixed

=item *

properly escape child properties in add.pl

=item *

removing an article now removes any associated images

=item *

removing an image from an article now removes the image file when you
save the article.

=item *

added datadump.pl (send an email containing a mysql datadump), with
configuration in Constants.pm

=item *

added imageclean.pl - cleans up the image table and images directory

=item *

added an advanced admin page with links to datadump.pl and
imageclean.pl (you can change these of course).

=item *

previously it was possible for a user with admin rights to choose a
template that was outside the templates directory.  

=back

=head2 0.08

=over 4

=item *

modified administration templates

=item *

formatting is now stripped from body text before an excerpt is
produced (for the search results).

=back

=head2 0.07

I'll add in the 0.07 change list as soon as I figure out what I changed...

Once I get my old 0.08 RC that may include the 0.07 change list.

=head2 0.06

Some changes are being made to allow the engine to be embedded into a
site (specifically squirrelweb.com.au).

=over 4

=item *

Bug fix: shop.pl had a silly exporter mistake, and a sillier reference
to an unknown variable name.

=item *

changed admin links to buttons for the catalog and product pages,
added a Display button to the product page.

=item *

cleaned up the shopitem, cart_base, checkout_base, checkoutfinal_base,
mailorder and mailconfirm templates, removing tags that don't work in
them, removing references to bodyscoop, fixing broken images, removed
thawte stamp.gif.

=item *

%EXTRA_TAGS now work in mailorder and mailconfirm templates

=item *

You can now use $SHOP_EMAIL_ORDER to disable sending the encrypted
order.  (Useful only for testing or until you get encryption keys
organized - there's no other way to get the credit card number and
expiry date.)

=item *

Generate/Product.pm had a hard-coded link to the internal test
site. (Doh!)

=item *

some base URIs can be configured, though this still needs some work.

=back

=head2 0.05

=over 4

=item *

Bug fix: only add the class attribute to thumbnails if one is supplied
(doh!)

=item *

Moved shop configuration from shop.pl to Constants.pm

=item *

Extended template field to 127 characters so directories can be used
without chopping off names.

=item *

Added installation documentation.

=item *

Templates in the drop-down lists in add.pl now includes templates from
$TMPLDIR/$level and $TMPLDIR/common.

=item *

crumbs now include the section, whether or not they are listed.

=item *

added templates.pod, which contains most templating documentation,
copied from new documentation in various places (shop.pl, search.pl,
Generate::*.pm).

=item *

search.pl wasn't handling single-quoted search terms correctly

=item *

added ifInMenu tag

=item *

more changes to support multiple catalogs:

=over 4

=item *

the initial catalog can be removed.  The initial catalog isn't useful
when you need more than one catalog.  If you want multiple catalogs
you need to remove the initial catalog and then add new ones.  The
templates need work too.

=item *

the link/admin fields for the new article are set correctly (oops)

=item *

added a sample section template for a multi-catalog shop

=back

=item *

the sample templates look better, along with better title images

=item *

the shop was being generated with a non-secure url

=item *

parent articles were not being regenerated when an article was deleted

=back

=head2 0.04

You will need to recreate the articles table, since a new column has
been added to support article thumbnails.

=over 4

=item *

Added article thumbnails.

=item *

Multiple product catalogs.

=item *

leadTime is now modifiable in products.

=item *

Bug fix: only list .tmpl files from template directories in article
editing forms.

=item *

Bug fix: prevent adding non-catalog subsections to the shop section.

=item *

Bug fix: the crumbs iterator no longer shows crumbs that have "don't
list in menu" set.  Such subsections often shouldn't be linked to.

=item *

The documentation on article templates has been improved.

=item *

Some tags that operate on articles have been expanded to work on all
article objects available in the template.
