=head1 NAME

config.pod - documents BSE configuration file options

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BSE historically used Constants.pm to keep most configuration
information.  The plan is to make sure any new configuration is kept
in bse.cfg, and to slowly move most configuration information into
bse.cfg.

Keeping configuration information in Constants.pm makes it difficult
to perform upgrades and makes it impossible to use tools such as
mod_perl, at least if you want more than one site on the machine.

=head1 CONFIGURATION ENTRIES

Contains various file system paths.

=over

completely implemented for now, so assume the default.  Default: admin
directory under $TMPLDIR.

implemented for now, so assume the default.  Default: $TMPLDIR.

=head2 [extensions]

This section is used by the file wizard to map uploaded file
extensions to MIME content types.  This can be used to extend
BSE::FileEditor's internal extension map.  It cannot override that
map.

The key for each entry is the extension, without the leading '.'.

eg.

  xls = application/msexcel
