=head1 NAME

config.pod - documents BSE configuration file options

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BSE historically used Constants.pm to keep most configuration
information.  The plan is to make sure any new configuration is kept
in bse.cfg, and to slowly move most configuration information into
bse.cfg.

Keeping configuration information in Constants.pm makes it difficult
to perform upgrades and makes it impossible to use tools such as
mod_perl, at least if you want more than one site on the machine.

=head1 CONFIGURATION ENTRIES

=head2 [site]

Contains URL configuration for the site.

=over

=item url

The normal URL for the non-secure parts of the site.

=item secureurl

The secure URL for the shop, products and other portions of the site
that should use SSL.  This isn't checked to make sure it is https.

=item name

Used as the site "name" in a few places.

=item adminurl

If set, this is used as the base URL for accessing the administrative
functions of your site.

=item secureadmin

Ignored if C<adminurl> is set.

If this is true then C<secureurl> is used as the base URL for
accessing the administrative functions of your site, otherwise C<url>
is used as the base URL.  Default: false (C<url>'s value is used)

=item forward_from

Configure the IP address of one or more front-end proxies.  This can
be a regular expression except that C<.> is translated to C<\.> and
C<*> is tranlated to C<.*> to give more glob() like matching.

If the reqesting host matches then admin site URL matching is done
against HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SERVER instead of SERVER_NAME.

Default: no front-end server configured.

=back

=head2 [paths]

Contains various file system paths.

=over

=item downloads

This is where the files uploads with the file wizard are stored.  It
must be writable by the web server user.

=item admin_templates

Directory containing administrative templates.  Note: this is not
completely implemented for now, so assume the default.  Default: admin
directory under $TMPLDIR.

=item templates

Directory base for most templates.

=item local_templates

Local Directory base for templates.  This is searched before the
templates directory.

=item images

Where uploaded images are stored.  This is not yet completely
implemented.  Default: $IMAGEDIR.

=item libraries

Local search path for BSE::Custom, or the class configured by
C<custom_class> in [basic].

=item siteuser_images

Where uploaded siteuser images are stored.  This must be set in the
config file.  The default bse.cfg include an entry to use the current
values of [paths].downloads

=item dynamic_cache

Pregenerated dynamic article pages are stored here.  This must be
defined if you site contains any dynamicly generated pages.

=item scalecache

The directory where cached versions of scaled thumbnails are stored.
Defaults to image_dir/scaled.  This must be in the document tree.  If
you set this you should also set scalecacheurl.

=item scalecacheurl

The URL to the directory represented by scalecache.  Defaults to
/images/scaled.

=back

=head2 [extensions]

This section is used by the file wizard to map uploaded file
extensions to MIME content types.  This can be used to extend
BSE::FileEditor's internal extension map.  It cannot override that
map.

The key for each entry is the extension, without the leading '.'.

eg.

  xls = application/msexcel

=head2 [templates]

Used for translating symbolic template names into full names under the
template directory.

In each case the default is the name with a C<.tmpl> extension.

=over

=item user/logon

user logon page

=item user/register

user registration page

=back

=head2 [admin templates]

Used for translating the names of administration templates into filenames.

Set to the empty string to suppress the charset keyword.  Default:
iso-8859-1.

=item redirect_links

If this is a non-zero number, then all but mailto links are redirected
to C<nuser.pl/redirect> so you can display a diclaimer.  If this
contained alphabetics it's treated as a comma separated list of url
schemes that should be handled via C<nuser.pl/redirect>.  If 0 or not
present, no redirection is done.

The redirect URL includes a hash of the url, title and the redirect
salt to prevent using this mechanism by external sites for cookie
stealing attacks.

=item redirect_salt

The salt used in generating the has for redirect_links.  Default: an
empty string.

=back

=head2 [basic]

=over

=item cookie_lifetime

The expiry time for cookies.  This should be in the form supported by
CGI.pm for the -expires parameter.  Typically you want a plus ('+'), a
number, and a time character (s - seconds, m - minutes, h - hours, d -
days, M - months).  Default: +3h

=item cookie_domain

This overrides the domain value set for cookies.  This is useful if
you allow the site to run under both example.com and www.example.com,
if you set cookie_domain to example.com then a user visiting
www.example.com will still have their cookies when they visit
example.com.

=item cookie_name

This overrides the cookie name used to store the session id.  Default:
sessionid.  This is useful when you have 2 sites under the same
top-level domain, and helps disambiguate the cookie returned by the
browser.

=item minpassword

=item randomdata

Device to read random data from.  This device should not block when it
runs out of entropy.

=item sign

If this is true then the encrypted messages containing the customer's
credit card number are sent to the shop owner signed.  To avoid
keeping a passphrase and signing key on the server you can set this to
false (0).  This has the effect that anyone could send you an unsigned
message encrypted with your public key, though this may not be a
security threat.  Default: True.

=item link_titles

If this is true then the links to your articles within BSE will be
followed by a / and then by a simplified version of the article title.
The aim is to include at least some title information in the URL
without modifying the name of the HTML file.  Default: False.

=item access_control

If this is true then the user/group/permissions database is used to
control access to the system.  Default: False.

authentication (usually Basic Authentication.)  You should normally
set this if you set htusers below.  Default: 0 (disabled)

=item htusers

This should be the path to a file to be updated with the list of users
and crypt() versions of their passwords.  If this is set then the
security system will check for a user set by the browser before
attempting a form based logon.  Default: None.

=item custom_class

The name of the custom class for your site.  This is currently only
used for article editing customizations.  This class should derive
from BSE::CustomBase.  Default: BSE::Custom.

=item jit_dynamic_pregen

If this is true, then pre-generation for dynamic pages will be delayed
until the page is displayed to a user.  Default: off.

=item staticajax

If true, the ifAjax and ajax tags will be active for static pages.

=item cache_thumbnails

If set to zero the results of the thumbimage/gthumbimage body/template
tags will not be cached.  Default: 1 (caching is enabled).

=item static_thumbnails

If true and cache_thumbnails is true then thumbnails for the thumbnail
cache will be generated when a static page is regenerated, and the
link from the page will link to the image in the cache rather than to
C<thumb.pl>.  Default: 1 (static thumbnails enabled).

=item alias_prefix

The prefix applied to articles that use a linkAlias url.  This should
start with a /.

=item use_alias

If this is non-zero then an article with linkAlias set will use an
alias url instead of the "real" url.  You will need to configure a
RewriteRule or ErrorDocument to page.pl to direct the user to the
correct URL.  Default: 1.

=item alias_suffix

If this is non-zero then the title is cleaned up (all but
alphanumerics removed) and appended to the alias URL generated.

=item default_popupimage

This is the default popup image class for the popimage[] and
gpopimage[] tags.  Default: popup.

=item warn_obsolete

Required if I<smtp_server> is set.

=item sendmail

The path to the C<sendmail> binary.  Default: /usr/lib/sendmail

You may want to add the -odq option to this if you want mail queued
rather than sent immediately.

=item set_errors_to_from

If true, we add an Errors-To header set to the same as the From
header.  Default: true.

=item html_system_email

in Constants.pm

=item to_email

To email for emailed orders sent by the shop.  Overrides $SHOP_TO_EMAIL
in Constants.pm

=over

=item logon_cookies

When a user logs on, and the site url is different to the secure url
BSE attempts to refresh to the other "side" of the site to set the
same cookie.

BSE does some simple comparisons to attempt to determine whether the
logon form was triggered on the secure side of the site (possibly from
the shop) or on the insecure side.  Since CGI doesn't necessarily give
us all the information required, it's possible it will guess wrong.

Setting this option to 1 will enable debugging information sent to
standard error, which will be sent to the error log on Apache.  This
probably isn't useful on IIS.

=item file_unlink

reserved for use by BSE internally, leaving lower-case letters and
digits for your own use.

Use the id of the flag as the key, and a description of the flag as
it's value.

=head2 [article uris]

Each key is an article id, the values are base URIs to store the HTML
form of those articles and their children under.

=head2 [protect link]

The keys are ids of articles that shouldn't have their link field
overwritten.  The value should be a true value, but is otherwise

well, or modify the registration template to include the given fields.

=item display_I<field name>

Controls how the given field is displayed in error messages.  If you
change the field names on the registration and/or options forms you
should probably change them here too.  Default: internal field name
with the first character converted to upper-case.

=item info_on_register

If this is set then the user info is prompted for during user
registration.  The information still isn't required unless the
appropriate require_I<field> option is set.  Default: false.

=item register_refresh

This section and [payment type descs] are used to configure new
paymeny type ids.

The key is the integer representing the payment type.  The value is
the name used in tags for checking the payment type.

You can also add a description (currently unused) to [payment type
descs].

You should use numbers starting from 10 to avoid conflicts with future
BSE payment types.

=head2 [payment type descs]

See [payment type names].

=head2 [payment type required]

Set the key given by the payment type id to a value of a
comma-separated list of fields required for that payment type.

=head2 [help style I<style-name>]

=head2 [includes]

Each value is used as the relative or absolute name of a file or
directory to load more configuration data from.

The keywords must remain unique.

Only the [includes] section from bse.cfg itself is used to locate more
configuration data.

If the value references a directory, all files with an extension of
C<.cfg> are read for configuration data.

The order the files are read (which later files overriding older
files) is:

=over

=item 1.

bse.cfg is read

=item 2.

the entries in [includes] are sorted alphabetically (or rather
asciily), so an entry with key "A" is read before one with key "B",
one with key "01" is read before "02", but key "10" would be read
I<before> key "2".

=item *

if an entry is a file then that is read and the values merged.

If an entry is not found in [product defaults] then [article defaults]
is also checked.

These sections are checked B<after> the C<[children of >I<id>C<]> and
C<[level >I<level>C<]> sections.

These defaults are used when creating an article where no value is
supplied, they can also be accessed via the <:default I<name>:> tag.

=head2 [newsletter filters]

Contains C<criteria>I<index> entries starting from C<criteria1>, then
C<criteria2>, etc.

Each entry consists of a filter class name, followed by a ; followed
by data passed to that filter.

  ; section [foo]
  criteria1=BSE::NLFilter::SQL;foo

See the documentation for each filter to configure the filters.

=head2 [Query Groups]

The key of each entry is the numeric identifier of a query group, the
values are the name of the query group.  For example:

  [query groups]
  1=some name

  [query group some name]
  sql=select id from site_users where id = ? and name1 like '%some%'

Each entry also has a corresponding [Query Group I<name>] section.

=head2 [query group I<name>]

This section corresponds to an entry in [Query Groups].

=over

=item sql

the siteuser id (primary key) of the user to be checked.  If this
query returns I<any> rows then the user is considered part of the
group.

=back

=head2 [template types]

when displaying the template dynamically.

=head2 [body class]

This section defines CSS class names for BSE's body text link tags.
The key is the tag name, the value is the CSS class to be used.

By default the class used is the same as the name of the tag, but you
can switch this off by adding an entry setting the class to the empty
string, for example:

  ; no class attribute for any of the links
  [body class]
  link=
  poplink=
  doclink=
  popdoclink=

You can set p here too to set the class for paragraphs generated as
body text.  By default no class is set.

=head2 [levelI<level> menus]

Where I<level> is the article level at which the defined menu options will be available.
Configure each menu value and description as I<key> and I<value>.

=over

For example:

  [level1 menus]
  0=Default
  1=Sidebar
  2=Footer

To create a menus using such values, use the "allkids_of" iterator "filter" option.

For example:

  <:iterator begin allkids_of -1 filter: [menu] == 2 :>

=back

=head2 [title alias]

Enable the "titleAlias" article field and set which level it will be available.

=over

=item levelI<level>

Where I<level> is the article "level" for which the "titleAlias" field should be enabled.  To enable
set the value to non-zero.

For example:

  [title alias]
  level1=1

The "titleAlias" can be used as an alternate "short" title for the given article, especially useful
for space critical iterated menus.  A template conditional can be used to display the "titleAlias" 
in place of the article "title" when appropriate.

=back

=head2 [thumb geometries]

Each key represents a geometry identifier for use by the thumbimage[],
gthumbimage[] body text tags and the <:thumbimage ...:>, <:gthumbimage
...:>, <:dthumbimage ...:> template tags.

The key is the geometry identifier, the value is the geometry string
as follows.

The geometry string consists of:

=over

=item *

dimensions

=item *

crop flag - if present

=item *

optional fill

=back

The dimensions can be in any of the following forms:

=over

=item *

<width>x<height> - the desired maximum width and height. eg 200x150

=item *

<width>x - the desired width, with the height calculated
proportionally based on the source image size

=item *

x<height> - the designed height, with the width calculated
proportionally based on the source image size.

=item *

<size> - the desired maximum size in both directions. so "200" is
equivalent to "200x200"

=back

The crop flag is a single letter "c", if present then the image should
be scaled so the smaller dimension matches the requested size, and the
longer dimension will be cropped to fit.

The fill if present is: fill(color) where color is a color recognized
by the underlying graphics implementation.  This should be at least
hex web colors without the #, eg fill(FF0000) will fill with red.

=head2 [thumb classes]

Each key represents a geometry identifier for use by the thumbimage[],
gthumbimage[] body text tags and the <:thumbimage ...:>, <:gthumbimage
...:>, <:dthumbimage ...:> template tags.

The value is used as the class for the generated img tag.

=head2 [targets]

Each value represents a handler or script name for the <:dyntarget
I<script> I<target> ...:> tag.

Each key has a TARGET version and a no-TARGET version, with the key
suffixed with C<_n>.

The default C<nuser> target is C</cgi-bin/nuser.pl/user/TARGET>.  The
default no-target C<nuser> is C</cgi-bin/nuser.pl/user>.

For other targets the default is
C</cgi-bin/>I<script>C<.pl?a_TARGET=1> and
C</cgi-bin/>I<script>C<.pl>.

The string C<TARGET> is replaced with the target specified in the
dyntarget tag.

This, along with dyntarget is intended to allow a more "Web 2.0" type
of access to BSE.  eg. you might set:

  [targets]
  shop=/xshop/TARGET
  shop_x=/xshop/

and have a rewrite rule:

  RewriteRule ^/xshop/(.*)$ /cgi-bin/nuser.pl/shop/$1 [PT]

=head2 [popimage class I<classname>]

This defines the settings for a class of images generated by the
popimage[] and gpopimage[] body text markup tags.  For example, the
settings for C<popimage[imageid|foo]> can be found in section
C<[popimage class foo]>.

=over

=item html

The html generated for this class.  Tags of the form
C<{>I<identifier>C<}> are replaced, where I<identifier> can be
C<inline_> or C<outline_> followed by an image field name, for example
C<inline_src> is the URL to the inline image.

Default: <a href="{outline_src}" rel="lightbox[id]" target="_blank"><img src="{inline_src}" alt="{inline_alt}" width="{inline_width}" height="{inline_height}" border="0" /></a>

The default may be tuned as needed.

=item inline

=back

=head2 [mail resources]

Each key is the identifier of a file that can be attached to
BSE::ComposeMail emails.  The value is comma separated filename,
content type, inline status.

The files are searched for through the template search mechanism, so
the filename can be relative to either the master or local templates
directories.

If the content type is not supplied, if the filename end in gif, png
or jpg the appropriate content type is used, otherwise
application/octet-stream.

If the inline status is not supplied then images are considered
inline, and other files arent.
