<h1>Image Wizard</h1>
<div>
  <h2><a name="file"></a>Image file to add</h2>

  <p>Either enter the name of an image on your 
computer, or use the Browse
button to select an image  file (Usually 
with a .GIF, .JPG, .PNG file extension).</p>
  <p>Please note that if 
you select a large image, it may take several
minutes to upload to 
the web server unless you have a large link.
eg. on a 56K link a 1 
megabyte file will take 4 minutes to upload,
assuming you have a 
perfect ISP.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2><a name="alt"></a>Alt text for image</h2>

  <p>Image Alt (alternate) text is only displayed when 
your browser does not display images. Setting Alt text is also 
helpful for sight impaired users who use screen 
readers.</p>

</div>
<div>
  <h2><a name="url"></a>URL for image</h2>
 
<p>An image can be used as a link. Input the desired URL (web 
address) in this field to make the image a clickable link to this 
URL.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2><a name="name"></a>Identifier</h2>

<p>This can be used to retrieve an article image by name with either
body markup or in templatess.  This can be either empty, or start with
a letter and contain only letters and number.  Each image name for an
article must be unique to that article.</p>

<p>The special identifier <code>bse_title</code> will treat the image
as an article title image, ie. the image will be displayed instead of
the title of the image.</p>

<p>Only images without identifiers are included in the normal
automatic image placment within <a href="body.html">body</a> text.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2><a name="position"></a>First image position</h2>

  <p>This option positions the first article image, 
based on this choice BSE attempts to arrange subsequent images as 
alternately staggered down the page.</p>

  <p>Relying on BSE to get 
a page layout to look good with multiple images is far from ideal, 
typically you will achieve much better results if you position images 
in the article body text manually. Refer to the <a 
href="body.html">body text markup</a> and look for 
&quot;image[<i>index</i>]&quot;.</p>
