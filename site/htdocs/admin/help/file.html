<h1>File Wizard</h1>
<div>
<h2><a name="file">File to add</h2>

<p>Either enter the name of a file on your machine, or use the Browse
button to select a file.</p>

<p>Please note that if you select a large file, it may take several
minutes to upload to the web server unless you have a large link.
eg. on a 56K link a 1 megabyte file will take 4 minutes to upload,
assuming you have a perfect ISP.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h2><a name="description">Description</h2>

<p>This text can be used in your templates to describe the file.</p>

</div>
<div>
  <h2><a name="content_type">Content type</h2>
<p>This is the format that the users browser will open the file as.
BSE understands common types such as PDF, text and HTML, and more can
be configured.</p>

<p>If BSE cannot guess the type of the file it will be set to
<b>application/octet-stream</b>, ie. a binary file</p>

<p>BSE guesses the file type based on its extension, if BSE's built-in
list of extensions is not matching your file, you can add extra
entries to the [content types] section of the configuration file.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h2><a name="download">Treat as download</h2>

<p>If this checkbox is checked then BSE will attempt to make the users
browser download the file rather than display it.</p>

  <p>This can be useful for some types such as PDF files, since
displaying PDFs can destabilise some browsers.</p>

</div>

<div>
<h2><a name="forSale">Require payment</h2>

<p>This should only be used for files attached to products.</p>

<p>If this is checked then the file can only be downloaded if the
product is attached to is included in an order the user made.</p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2><a name="requireUser">Require login</h2>

<p>The user must be registered and logged in before they can download
the file.</p>

</div>
