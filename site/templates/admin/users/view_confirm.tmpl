<p>If you have received written permission, you can mark this user as
confirmed.  Note that marking a user as confirmed may result in them
receiving email subscriptions, which if they haven't subscribed to may
be in violation of the spam act.</p>

<p>Note: an attacker may sign users up to your site's newsletters in
an attempt to mail bomb them, the normal email confirmation mechanism
prevents your newsletters from going to users who don't want them, in
general you should rely upon this and only click below as a last
resort after you have written permission.</p>
