BSE
===

BSE is an engine for presenting a simple portal site with an attached
store.

The current feature set includes:

- all articles are kept in a mysql database
- data/actions are kept separate from presentation
- a simple store with encrypted email to the administrator on order 
  processing

No, BSE doesn't stand for bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  Not here,
anyway.

For version information please see site/docs/bse.pod

Installation documentation can be found in INSTALL.* and plenty of
other documentation can be found in site/docs/
