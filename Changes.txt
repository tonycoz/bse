BSE 0.22 - unreleased
========

Bug fixes:

 - the search index builder was ignoring configured field scores.

 - the customer is no longer asked to select a shipper and shipping is
   set to zero for orders where all products have zero weight.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1328

 - template engine: template tags implemented as a literal were no
   replaced when that literal was false. (4a446ac3)
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1342

Enhancements:

 - automatic image insertion can now be disabled globally or on a
   per-article basis.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1331

 - templating re-re-work:
   - still backward compatible
   - new, faster, more regular processing internal to tags:
     - variables supplied by code, similarly to TT, Mason
     - macro definitions
     - call macros or files with parameters and localized variables
   - integration into BSE itself still limited, but one step at a
     time.

 - briefly documented bsexlsprod.pl (site/docs/bse_import.pod)

 - bsexlsprod.pl can now update article tags

 - bsexlsprod.pl can now update tiered pricing

 - make the eimage variable available on the admin/image_edit template
   and use it to display a thumbnail.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1290

Templates:

 - admin/order_detail.tmpl - the product tag now uses tag_article as
   it should.

 - admin/subscr/list - isubscription is now an object tag, giving
   access to the is_removable method
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1323

 - admin/subscr/edit, admin/subscr/detail - subscription is now an
   object tag

BSE 0.21 - 07 Mar 2012
========

 - Squirrel::Template has largely been rewritten performing a parsing
   then a processing step rather than doing many, many s/// over the
   template text.

 - verbose output of generate.pl is now based on the template
   admin/generate.tmpl

 - add the referer tag to all dynamic pages

 - added [undeletable articles] to bse.cfg as a supplement to
   @NO_DELETE.  @NO_DELETE is now deprecated and may be removed in a
   future release of BSE.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1209

 - iterator inlines can now be filtered (Adrian Oldham)

 - added some more extension to content type mappings for video
   formats (Adrian Oldham)

 - the shopadmin order list targets are now much more efficient - they
   no longer load the entire order table, are paginated, and let the
   data do the selection of matching records.

   NOTE: this removes some backward compatibility - iterator filters
   no longer work and a new tag, all_order_count can be used to fetch
   order counts.  Extra search parameters have been provided to filter
   the results.

 - added a new adminurl2 tag where the second parameter is a target.

 - siteusers.pl now flashes all success messages, and success message
   text is fetched from the messages table

 - added is_released and is_expired methods to Article.  This should
   be visible to article tags in templates.

 - more consistently use tag_article on the admin side of the site.

 - make tag_article smarter so it can call more methods

 - consistently use admin_tags instead of the old collection of admin
   tag methods.

 - tag_object (used for object style tags) now checks
   restricted_method() if implemented for the object.

 - the editor file iterator is now an object iterator, and the efile
   tag on the file edit page is now an object tag

 - add file_exists to BSE::TB::Article::File
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1288

 - refactored makeIndex.pl into makeIndex.pl (web) and
   util/bse_makeindex.pl (console).
   Output from these is now encoded using the default BSE encoding.
   makeIndex.pl can now produce HTML output using admin/makeindex.tmpl
   The bse_make_index background process now uses the console version.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1301

 - admin-mode article links now ignore the admin value stored in the
   article record and always return a link to admin.pl for that
   article.

 - add a missing comma to BSE::UI, preventing a warning.

Bug fixes:

 - thumb.pl would return content types with doubled image/ prefixes,
   eg. image/image/jpeg

 - update BSE::AdminUsers, BSE::ChangePW, BSE::UI::AdminReport to use
   more modern admin tags
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1234 (partial)
   (Adrian Oldham for BSE::ChangePW, BSE::UI::AdminReport)

 - with [site].secureadmin enabled, refreshes to the secure admin url
   could cause a 500 error.

 - check nomatch fields even for blank fields.  Otherwise a field with
   a LF or CR would not be caught by the dh_one_line validation rule.

 - saving a tag from the tag manager without changing the name or
   deleting a tag that doesn't exist would result in a 500 error.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1287

 - setting an unfilled order's stage to "shipped" now sets whoFilled
   and whenFilled for the order.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1286

 - an empty title (but no missing) when saving a user or group file no
   longer defaults that to the file display name.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1303

 - validation errors are now correctly displayed for adding a user or
   group file
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1302

 - supplying an empty content type when saving a user or group file
   now resets the content type to that derived from the file's display
   name.
   https://rt4.develop-help.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=1304

 - fix the message id for the "move up a level to section" message in
   the possible parents drop down.

 - error_img would produce an inline stack trace from an internal
   error on a failed logon. (logon.pl)

Templates:

 - admin/order_list*.tmpl - see the order list re-work above.

 - you can now use <:- and -:> as tag delimiters to consume whitespace
   on the left and right of the tag.

 - Squirrel::Template now documents the template syntax more regularly.

 - Squirrel::Template is now much faster in most cases.

 - admin/subscr/detail - the subscription orders iterator now includes
   the billFirstName, billLastName and filled fields from the
   order. (Adrian Oldham)

Internals:

 - added a getCount() method to retrieve a count of matching records.

BSE 0.20 - 22 Dec 2011
========

Please read any NOTES below carefully.

 - store a truncated card number for credit card payments (both online
   and email).  Reinstate storage of the card holder name in ccName.
   ccNumberHash is no longer populated.

 - ifNeedDelivery (checkoutnew_base.tmpl) wasn't being reset on order
   submission.

 - the site_users table has been refactored into the bse_siteusers
   table, removing the bill* fields and adding deliv* fields.  Other
   obsolete fields have also been removed.

   NOTE: To preserve your registered users on upgrade, run the
   provided schema/site_users_to_members.sql SQL through the mysql
   tool.  This will create entries in bse_siteusers corresponding to
   those in your original site_users table.  You MUST start with an
   empty bse_siteusers table or the script will throw an error.

   NOTE: Any configuration such as report definitions, query group
   definitions should now refer to bse_siteusers instead of
   site_users.

 - Data::UUID 1.148 is now required

 - remove target entry for the shop confirm action, which was
   otherwise removed years ago. RT #1280.

 - logon now starts a new session, preserving the cart.  As a
   side-effect this logs out the admin user, though this may
   change.  RT #1279.

 - passing a new session id between the SSL and non-SSL versions of
   the site is now validated.  RT #1279.

   NOTE: This requires that [site].secret be set to a value specific
   to your site.  Running:

     openssl rand -base64 32

   generates a suitable value.

 - delete the session data for a site users session when they logoff.
   As a side effect this will log out the admin user.

 - allow dynamic content pages to display flashed messages with the
   message tag.  Note that not all actions flash a message.

Template updates:

 - checkoutpay_base.tmpl - the name of the cardHolder payment field is
   now ccName.

 - admin/order_detail.tmpl - order ccPAN can be used to display the
   truncated card number.

 - user/options_billing_base.tmpl and its generated template have been
   renamed with s/billing/delivery/ since it now contains delivery
   details.  The link to it from user/options(_base).tmpl has also
   been updated.

 - user/options_base.tmpl, user/register_base.tmpl,
   admin/users/(add,edit,view).tmpl have been updated to match the new
   site users schema.

 - user/logon_base.tmpl, user/register_base.tmpl - updated the
   "nothing is more permanent that a temporary solution" link text for
   logon, register and recover password.

 - shopitem.tmpl - display the flashed message, if any.

 - removed the unused checkoutcard and checkoutconfirm templates

 - added admin/generate.tmpl for generate.pl progress output.

 - added admin/makeindex.tmpl for search index verbose output

Internals:

 - Squirrel::Table->make now looks for default_I<colname> when looking
   for default values for a column.
