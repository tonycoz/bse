BSE 0.20 (unreleased)
========

Please read any NOTES below carefully.

 - store a truncated card number for credit card payments (both online
   and email).  Reinstate storage of the card holder name in ccName.
   ccNumberHash is no longer populated.

 - ifNeedDelivery (checkoutnew_base.tmpl) wasn't being reset on order
   submission.

 - the site_users table has been refactored into the bse_siteusers
   table, removing the bill* fields and adding deliv* fields.  Other
   obsolete fields have also been removed.

   NOTE: To preserve your registered users on upgrade, run the
   provided schema/site_users_to_members.sql SQL through the mysql
   tool.  This will create entries in bse_siteusers corresponding to
   those in your original site_users table.  You MUST start with an
   empty bse_siteusers table or the script will throw an error.

   NOTE: Any configuration such as report definitions, query group
   definitions should now refer to bse_siteusers instead of
   site_users.

 - Data::UUID 1.148 is now required

Template updates:

 - checkoutpay_base.tmpl - the name of the cardHolder payment field is
   now ccName.

 - admin/order_detail.tmpl - order ccPAN can be used to display the
   truncated card number.

 - user/options_billing_base.tmpl and its generated template have been
   renamed with s/billing/delivery/ since it now contains delivery
   details.  The link to it from user/options(_base).tmpl has also
   been updated.

 - user/options_base.tmpl, user/register_base.tmpl,
   admin/users/(add,edit,view).tmpl have been updated to match the new
   site users schema.

Internals:

 - Squirrel::Table->make now looks for default_I<colname> when looking
   for default values for a column.
